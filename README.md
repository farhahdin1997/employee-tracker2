# Employee Tracker

## Description
Non-developers frequently require developers to provide interfaces that allow them to view and interact with data stored in databases. Content management systems are the names for these interfaces (CMS). This week's task is to use Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to create a command-line application from the ground up to manage a company's employee database.
